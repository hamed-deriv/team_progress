### Prepare conventions and Linter rules and apply them in the DP2P project

#### Benefits

- Improved readability: Code conventions help to make the code more consistent and easy to read, which can help developers understand and work with the code more easily.
- Enhanced maintainability: By following code conventions, developers can write code that is easier to maintain over time. This can help reduce the amount of time and effort required to fix bugs or make changes to the codebase.
- Enhanced collaboration: Code conventions can help to establish a common coding style that all team members can follow, which can make it easier for developers to work together and collaborate on projects.
- Improved quality: Code conventions can help to ensure that the code is of high quality, as they encourage the use of best practices and can help prevent common coding errors.
  **State** _Code Conventions and Linter rules are Ready and DP2P implementation is In Progress_

### Writing justification for code conventions

#### Benefits

- Writing justifications for linter rules can help developers to understand the reasoning behind the rule and the benefits of following it. This can be particularly useful when working on a team where multiple developers may have different coding styles and preferences.

### Migration to a new ORM

#### Benefits

- Improved performance: New ORM frameworks are often designed to be more efficient and perform better than their older counterparts. Migrating to a new ORM can help improve the performance of the app.
- Enhanced security: Previous ORM framework may contain known vulnerabilities that have not been fixed. Migrating to a new ORM can help ensure that the app is more secure.
- New features and improvements: New ORM frameworks often include new features and improvements that can help improve the functionality and user experience of the app.
- Better support: Previous ORM framework is no longer actively maintained or supported. Migrating to a new ORM can ensure that you have access to ongoing support and updates.
- Enhanced compatibility: New ORM frameworks are often designed to be more compatible with the latest versions of software and platforms. Migrating to a new ORM can help ensure that the app works seamlessly on newer devices and platforms.

### Migrate DP2P data layer to Flutter Deriv API version 3

#### Benefits

- Reduced development time: Autogenerated models can be created much faster than manually designed models, as they are generated automatically based on input data. This can help to reduce the time and effort required to develop a model, which can be particularly useful for projects with tight deadlines or limited resources.
- Increased accuracy: Autogenerated models can often achieve higher levels of accuracy than manually designed models, as they are optimized based on the input data and can take into account a wider range of factors. This can make them more effective at solving complex problems or making accurate predictions.
- Enhanced flexibility: Autogenerated models can be easily adjusted or modified based on new input data or changing requirements. This can make them more flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances, which can be particularly useful in dynamic or rapidly evolving environments.
- Reduced risk of error: Autogenerated models can reduce the risk of human error, as they are created automatically based on input data rather than being manually designed. This can help to reduce the risk of errors or bugs in the model, which can improve its accuracy and reliability.
  **State** _First Phase is completed, Second Phase is In Progress_

### Develop a Micro Framework

#### Benefits

- Improved code quality: By using a consistent micro framework, the team can help to ensure that the codebase is well-structured, easy to read, and free of errors or bugs. This can improve the overall quality of the codebase and reduce the risk of problems or issues arising.
- Uniform code base: Using a micro framework can help to promote uniformity in the codebase by providing a set of core functionality and guidelines for how to use it. This can help to ensure that all team members are working to the same standards and following the same conventions, which can improve the overall consistency and quality of the codebase.
- Reduce onboarding time: Using a micro framework can help to reduce the onboarding time for new team members, as it provides a smaller and more focused set of tools and functionality for them to learn. This can make it easier for new team members to understand the codebase and get up to speed with the project more quickly.
